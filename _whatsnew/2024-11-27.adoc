=== Amazon EC2 migration advisor improvements

This release of Workload Factory for VMware features several improvements to the migration advisor experience:
* Data collection: the ability to collect data for a specific time period when you use the migration advisor.
* VM selection: Workload factory for VMware now supports selecting VMs that you want to include in your migration deployment.
* Quick vs. Advanced experience: You can choose a quick migration advisor experience, using RVtools, or the more in depth advanced experience, which uses the migration advisor data collector.
