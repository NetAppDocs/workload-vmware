=== Introducing the VMware workloads planning center

The VMware workloads planning center enables you to view and manage your VM inventory and migration plans from one place. You can upload and save multiple VM inventories from different environments, and start planning a migration to AWS EC2 or Amazon Elastic VMware service for any of them. You can also create and save AWS EC2 or EVS migration plans.
