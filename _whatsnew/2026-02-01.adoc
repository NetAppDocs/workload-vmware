=== Well-architected analysis for Amazon Elastic VMware Service

Workload Factory now provides automated well-architected analysis for your Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS) environments. Daily scans identify configuration misalignments and offer detailed remediation recommendations to help you maintain optimal operations, security, and cost efficiency.

Scans are performed using AWS APIs—no vSphere credentials or vCenter connectivity required. Results are available in the new *Well-architected status* tab within your EVS environment details.

This release includes insights for:

* *Instance stop/termination protection status*: Identifies EVS nodes without EC2 stop or termination protection. Stopping or terminating EVS nodes from the EC2 console can lead to virtual machine data unavailability or data loss.
* *Cluster node partition placement alignment*: Detects partitioning misalignments that could result in significant processing power loss or downtime if a partition fails within an AWS Availability Zone.
Each insight includes severity levels, detailed findings with impacted resource information, and step-by-step remediation procedures based on AWS best practices.
