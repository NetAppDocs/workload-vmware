=== Well-architected dashboard for Amazon Elastic VMware Service

Workload Factory now provides automated well-architected analysis for your Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS) environments. Daily scans are performed to identify configuration misalignments and provide detailed remediation recommendations to help you maintain optimal operations, security, and cost efficiency.

Workload Factory performs automatic scans using AWS APIs without requiring vSphere credentials or connectivity to your vCenter. All discovered EVS environments are scanned once per day, and you can view the results in the new *Well-architected status* tab within your EVS environment details.

The release includes insights for:

* *Instance stop/termination protection status*: Identifies EVS nodes without EC2 stop protection or termination protection configured. Stopping or terminating EVS nodes from the EC2 console can lead to virtual machine data unavailability or data loss. The tab provides step-by-step remediation procedures to enable these critical protections.

* *Cluster nodes partition placement alignment*: Detects partitioning misalignments that could result in significant processing power loss or downtime in case of a partition failure within the AWS availability zone. The tab identifies whether nodes are members of multiple placement groups, non-partitioned placement groups, or placement groups with fewer than 4 partitions.

Each insight includes severity levels, detailed findings with impacted resource information, and step-by-step remediation procedures based on AWS best practices.
