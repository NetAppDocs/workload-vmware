Workload Factory analyzes Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS) configurations regularly to determine if there are any issues. When issues are found, Workload Factory shows you what the issues are and explains what needs to change to ensure your environment achieves peak performance, cost efficiency, and compliance with best practices.

Key capabilities include:

* Daily configuration analysis
* Automatic best practice validations
* Proactive observability
* Insights to action

== Well-architected status

In the Workload Factory console, well-architected status is listed for all discovered EVS virtualization environments. Well-architected statuses are categorized as "Optimized" or "Not optimized". Selecting Inventory directs you to the Well-architected status tab within the environment where you can find all configurations for the environment.

* *Configuration categories*
+
The environment configurations display labels indicating the areas of impact. The categories include:
+
** Availability: How accessible and operational the EVS configuration is expected to be.
** Security: How well the EVS configuration protects data and controls access. An example configuration is EC2 stop and termination protection.
** Resiliency: The ability of the EVS configuration to recover from failures or disruptions.
