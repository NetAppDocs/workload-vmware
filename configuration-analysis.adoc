[.lead]
Workload Factory analyzes Amazon Elastic VMware Service (EVS) configurations regularly to identify misalignments with best practices. Use the results to improve performance, cost efficiency, and compliance.

Key capabilities include:

* Daily configuration analysis
* Automatic best practice validations
* Proactive observability
* Insights to action

== Well-architected status

In the Workload Factory console, well-architected status is listed for all discovered EVS virtualization environments. Well-architected statuses are categorized as "Optimized" or "Not optimized". Selecting *Inventory* directs you to the Well-architected status tab within the environment where you can find all configurations for the environment.

== Configuration categories
Workload Factory evaluates EVS configurations across multiple categories to ensure alignment with AWS and NetApp best practices. Each category focuses on specific aspects of your EVS environment:

Availability:: How accessible and operational the EVS configuration is expected to be.
Security:: How well the EVS configuration protects data and controls access (for example, EC2 stop and termination protection).
Resiliency:: The ability of the EVS configuration to recover from failures or disruptions.
