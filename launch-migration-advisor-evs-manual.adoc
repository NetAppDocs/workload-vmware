Log in to the NetApp Workload Factory to access the VMware planning center. From there, you can manually create a deployment plan or migration plan for Amazon EVS that is customized for your needs.

You can manually specify your requirements for virtual machines in Amazon Elastic VMware Service and use customized Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems as external datastores.

== Requirements

* You must have a user name and password to access Workload Factory. If you don't have access, create an account now. See the instructions https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/quick-start.html[here].
* You must have an Amazon Elastic VMware Service subscription.

== Steps

. Log in to Workload Factory using one of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

. Select the menu image:workloads-menu-icon.png[The hamburger menu icon is used to navigate to workloads like storage, eda, ai, databases, vmware, and administration.] and then select *VMware*. 
+
The planning center is displayed.
. Select *Manually create EVS plan*.
. Enter the requirements for your VM environment.
+
[NOTE]
========
Keep in mind the following VM migration performance requirements and recommendations:

* A minimum storage capacity of 10TiB is recommended for the VM inventory for performance reasons.
* A minimum throughput is required for the Amazon Elastic VMware Service datastores, depending on the required number of IOPS you specify for this deployment.
* Depending on the FSx for ONTAP filesystem configuration, a minimum number of external datastores is required for the Amazon Elastic VMware Service environment to reach optimal performance.
========
. When ready, select *Review plan* to review the migration plan.
. Review the plan. Expand each section to view the plan details.
+
By default, Workload Factory saves the migration plan to the planning center. You can deselect this option near the top of the page.
. Optionally, you can export the migration plan as a PDF or CSV file by selecting  *Manage plan* at the top right of the page and then selecting *Download a report (.pdf)* or *Download VM storage deployment (.csv)*.
+
The .csv file creates a map of all the VMs included in the migration plan, along with their assigned storage volumes.
. When you are ready to provision the deployment plan, select *Provision*.
