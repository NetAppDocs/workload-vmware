Log in to the NetApp Workload Factory to access the VMware migration advisor. You'll follow the steps in the wizard to create a deployment plan or migration plan that is customized for your needs.


Note that you must have a user name and password to access Workload Factory. If you don't have access, create an account now. See the instructions https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/quick-start.html[here].

== Create a deployment plan based on an on-premises vSphere environment

You can migrate your current virtual machine configurations in on-premises vSphere environments to virtual machines in Amazon EC2 and use customized Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems as external datastores.

.Requirements

* You must have link:upload-vm-inventory.html[uploaded a VM inventory].
//* You must have access to the inventory file from the system on which you are logging in to Workload Factory.

.Steps

. Log in to Workload Factory using one of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

. From the VMware workloads tile, select *VMware planning center*.
+
The planning center is displayed.
. If you have not yet uploaded a VM inventory, select *Upload VM inventory* and follow the instructions in link:upload-vm-inventory.html[Upload VM inventory data].
. Choose a VM inventory dataset from the list, and open the *Start planning* menu for the dataset.
. Select *AWS native compute*.
+
The *Prepare for AWS Cloud onboarding* page is displayed.
. In the _VM configuration upload_ section, select image:button-upload-file.png[the upload button] and select the .xlsx file created by RVTools.
+
The *Data collection details* section provides the date range and number of hours of data that was collected using the Onboarding Advisor data collector. 
+
The *VM inventory summary* section is populated from the inventory file to reflect the number of VMs and the total storage capacity.
. In the _VM inventory considerations_ section, select the options to filter the list of VMs that you want to migrate.
.. *Region*: Select the region where Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems will be deployed. For optimal performance and cost efficiency, this is typically the same region as where your existing Amazon EC2 SDDC is deployed.
.. Choose a predicted performance level for the VMs in this region. We recommend that you begin with a smaller IOPS setting. You can increase your provisioned SSD IOPS after the file system is created as workloads are migrated or deployed:
+
* *Standard to high performance*: For VMs with average IO rates between 20 and 5000 IOPS.
* *Very high performance*: For VMs with average IO rates of greater than 5000 IOPS.
* *Very low performance*: For VMs with average IO rates lower than 20 IOPS.
. In the _Target capacity and protection considerations_ section, select from a few storage options.
.. *VM Storage to consider*: Select whether the datastores created for each onboarded VM are sized based on their currently utilized size (recommended) or their provisioned size. 
+
The external datastores will be implemented using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system volumes.
.. *Average data reduction ratio*: Choose from among the three common data reduction ratios. Select "1:1 - No reduction", "1:1.25 - 20% reduction", or "1:1.5 - 33% reduction".
+
Select *Help me decide* if you're unsure which ratio to choose. The _Data reduction ratio assistant_ dialog appears. Select any statements that apply to your VM inventory and storage estate. The assistant will recommend an appropriate data reduction rate. Select *Apply* to use the recommended ratio.  
.. *Headroom percentage*: Enter the percentage of capacity growth that is added to the capacity for your FSx for ONTAP file systems.
+
Note that if you select an amount less than 20% you won't be able to create volume snapshots for protection and long-term backups.
.. *VM snapshot protection*: Enable this option to protect the VMs with snapshots.
. Select *Next*. 
. On the *Scope* page, select the VMs from the list that you want to include in the AWS migration. You can filter the list by the power state of each VM, and which data center and cluster the VM resides in.
+
In the VM list, you can select which types of VM information to display as columns. For example, selecting _Estimated instance type_ displays a column with the estimated Amazon EC2 instance type for each VM, based on the VM resource requirements.
. Select *Next*.
. On the *Classify* page, review the VM information, volume classification rules, volume assignments, and list of volumes that will be migrated as part of deployment, and then select *Next*.
+
NOTE: If a volume has capacity or performance requirements that exceed the capabilities of an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP filesystem in a specific region, migration advisor recommends that the volume be deployed on an Amazon EBS filesystem.
. On the *Package* page, review the EC2 instances and the volumes assigned to different FSx for ONTAP clusters, and then select *Next*.
. On the *Review plan* page, review the estimated monthly savings and cost estimates for all the VMs that you plan to migrate.
+
The top of the page estimates the monthly savings for FSx for ONTAP file systems and EBS volumes. You can expand each section to view details for the suggested filesystem configuration, estimated savings breakdown, assumptions, and technical disclaimers.
+
The migration plan is automatically saved in the list of plans in the planning center by default.
+
When you are satisfied with the migration plan, you have a few options:

* Select *Download plan > Download a report* to download the deployment plan in a .pdf format so you can distribute the plan for review.
* Select *Download plan > Download instance storage deployment* to download the external datastore deployment plan in a .csv format so you can use it to create your new cloud-based intelligent data infrastructure.
* Select *Provision* to begin deploying the recommended Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.
