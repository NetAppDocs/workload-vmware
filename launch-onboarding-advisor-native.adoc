Log in to the NetApp workload factory to access the VMware migration advisor. You'll follow the steps in the wizard to create a deployment plan or migration plan that is customized for your needs.

//When migrating to Amazon EC2, you can use the migration advisor to create a deployment plan for the following scenarios:

//* <<Create a deployment plan based on an on-premises vSphere environment,To migrate your current on-premises vSphere environment to Amazon EC2.>>
//* <<Create a deployment plan based on an existing plan,To deploy a system in the cloud based on an existing deployment plan that has similar requirements.>>

Note that you must have a user name and password to access workload factory. If you don't have access, create an account now. See the instructions https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/quick-start.html[here].

== Create a deployment plan based on an on-premises vSphere environment

You can migrate your current virtual machine configurations in on-premises vSphere environments to virtual machines in Amazon EC2 and use customized Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems as external datastores.

.Requirements

* You must have created the inventory file from your existing systems by using the migration advisor VM collector (.zip file) or by using RVTools (.xlsx file).
* You must have access to the inventory file from the system on which you are logging in to workload factory.

.Steps

. Log in to workload factory using one of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

. From the VMware workloads tile, select *Access and plan* and then select *Migration to AWS native compute*. The VMware migration advisor splash screen is displayed.
+
Review the information to learn about the benefits of the migration advisor.
. When ready, select *Let's start*.

. Choose the level of detail and method you prefer during the process of collecting VM information:
+
* *Quick assessment*: This option uses an RVtools inventory file to retrieve information about your VMs during an accelerated process, resulting in a design blueprint for your cloud migration.
* *Detailed planning*: Use the migration advisor data collector inventory file to collect detailed information, resulting in a deployment-ready design.

.. Choose a predicted performance level for the VMs in this region. We recommend that you begin with a smaller IOPS setting. You can increase your provisioned SSD IOPS after the file system is created as workloads are migrated or deployed:
+
* *Standard to high performance*: For VMs with average IO rates between 20 and 5000 IOPS.
* *Very high performance*: For VMs with average IO rates of greater than 5000 IOPS.
* *Very low performance*: For VMs with average IO rates lower than 20 IOPS.
. In the _Target capacity and protection considerations_ section, select from a few storage options.
.. *VM Storage to consider*: Select whether the datastores created for each onboarded VM are sized based on their currently utilized size (recommended) or their provisioned size. 
+
The external datastores will be implemented using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system volumes.
.. *Average data reduction ratio*: Choose from among the three common data reduction ratios. Select "1:1 - No reduction", "1:1.25 - 20% reduction", or "1:1.5 - 33% reduction".
+
Select *Help me decide* if you're unsure which ratio to choose. The _Data reduction ratio assistant_ dialog appears. Select any statements that apply to your VM inventory and storage estate. The assistant will recommend an appropriate data reduction rate. Select *Apply* to use the recommended ratio.  
.. *Headroom percentage*: Enter the percentage of capacity growth that is added to the capacity for your FSx for ONTAP file systems.
+
Note that if you select an amount less than 20% you won't be able to create volume snapshots for protection and long-term backups.
.. *VM snapshot protection*: Enable this option to protect the VMs with snapshots.
. Select *Next*. 
. On the *Scope* page, select the VMs from the list that you want to include in the AWS cloud migration, and select *Next*.
. On the *Classify* page, review the VM information, volume classification rules, volume assignments, and list of volumes that will be migrated as part of deployment, and then select *Next*.
. On the *Package* page, review the EC2 instances and the volumes assigned to different FSx for ONTAP clusters, and then select *Next*.
. On the *Review plan* page, review the estimated monthly savings and cost estimates for all the VMs that you plan to migrate.
