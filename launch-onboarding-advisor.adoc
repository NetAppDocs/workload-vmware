Log in to the NetApp Workload Factory to access the VMware Cloud on AWS onboarding advisor. You'll follow the steps in the wizard to create a deployment plan or migration plan that is customized for your needs.

.About this task

The onboarding advisor can be used to help you migrate your current systems to the cloud, or to deploy a system that meets certain requirements based on an existing deployment plan.

.Requirements

* You must have a user name and password to access Workload Factory. If you don't have access, create an account now. See the instructions https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/quick-start.html[here].

* If you plan to migrate an existing configuration, you must have access to the Onboarding Advisor Data Collector .csv file or the RVTools .xlsx file from the system on which you are logging in to Workload Factory.

* If you plan to customize an existing deployment plan, you must have access to the .json file for that plan.

== Migrate an existing on-premises vSphere environment

You can migrate your current virtual machine configurations in on-premises vSphere environments to virtual machines in VMware Cloud on AWS and use customized Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems as external datastores.

.Requirements

* You must have created the inventory file from your existing systems by using the Onboarding Advisor Data Collector (.csv file) or by using RVTools (.xlsx file).
* You must have access to the inventory file from the system on which you are logging in to Workload Factory.

.Steps

. Log in to Workload Factory.

. From the VMware workloads tile, click *Plan and deploy* and the "VMware onboarding advisor" main page is displayed.

.Use inventory file from the Onboarding Advisor data collector
--
. Click *Use the Onboarding Advisor data collector* and click *Next*.

. Complete the fields in the "Prepare for VMware Cloud onboarding" page by opening each of the 4 sections: 
.. *Select inventory file*. Click the up-arrow button and select the Onboarding Advisor Data Collector .csv file that you want to use. +
The VM inventory summary section is populated to reflect the VMs in the inventory file.
.. *Consider VMs*. Indicate which VMs will be extracted from the .csv file based on their operating power state. You can bring in all VMs, or only those that are On, Off, or Suspended.
.. *VM Storage*. Select whether the datastores created for each onboarded VM are sized based on their current Utilized size (recommended) or the Provisioned size. 
+
The external datastores will be implemented using Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems.
.. *VM Memory*. Select whether the memory allocated for each onboarded VM is sized based on the current Utilized size (recommended) or the Provisioned size.
.. *Region*. Select the region where the VMs and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems will be deployed. 
+
For optimal performance and cost efficiency, this is typically the same region as where your existing VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC is deployed.
.. *vSphere cluster host preference*. Select the type of ESXi host that will be used in the vSphere cluster for the VMs. See https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-on-AWS/services/com.vmware.vmc-aws-operations/GUID-98FD3BA9-8A1B-4500-99FB-C40DF6B3DA95.html[VMware Cloud on AWS Host Types] for more details.
.. *vSAN architecture*. Select whether you want to use vSAN Express Storage Architecture (ESA) or vSAN Original Storage Architecture (OSA) architecture.
.. *vSAN Fault Tolerance*. Select the level of fault tolerance that is required for the VMs. You can choose “Auto” or from among a variety of RAID levels.
* RAID-1 (FTT 1) - consists of an exact copy (or mirror) of a set of data on 2 or more disks.
* RAID-5 (FTT 1) - consists of block-level striping with distributed parity - parity information is distributed among 3 or more drives, and it can survive a single disk failures.
* RAID-5 (FTT 2) - consists of block-level striping with distributed parity - parity information is distributed among 4 or more drives, and it can survive any two concurrent disk failures.
* RAID-6 (FTT 2) - extends RAID 5 by adding another parity block; thus, it uses block-level striping with two parity blocks distributed across all member disks. It requires 4 or more drives, and it can survive any two concurrent disk failures.
.. *Average data reduction ratio*. Choose from among the three common data reduction selection values. Select “1:1 - No reduction”, “1:1.25 - 20% reduction”, or “1:1.5 - 33% reduction”.
.. *Headroom percentage*. Enter the percentage of capacity growth that is added to the capacity for your FSx for ONTAP systems. 
+
Note that if you select an amount less than 20% that you won't be able to create volume snapshots for protection and long-term backups.

.Use inventory file from RVTools
--
. Click *Use RVTools** and click *Next*.

. Complete the fields in the "Prepare for VMware Cloud onboarding" page by opening each of the 4 sections: 
.. *Select inventory file*. Click the up-arrow button and select the Onboarding Advisor Data Collector .csv file that you want to use. +
The VM inventory summary section is populated to reflect the VMs in the inventory file.
.. *Consider VMs*. Indicate which VMs will be extracted from the .csv file based on their operating power state. You can bring in all VMs, or only those that are On, Off, or Suspended.

.. *vSAN architecture*. Select whether you want to use vSAN Express Storage Architecture (ESA) or vSAN Original Storage Architecture (OSA) architecture.
.. *vSAN Fault Tolerance*. Select the level of fault tolerance that is required for the VMs. You can choose “Auto” or from among a variety of RAID levels.
* RAID-1 (FTT 1) - consists of an exact copy (or mirror) of a set of data on 2 or more disks.

* RAID-6 (FTT 2) - extends RAID 5 by adding another parity block; thus, it uses block-level striping with two parity blocks distributed across all member disks. It requires 4 or more drives, and it can survive any two concurrent disk failures.
.. *VM Performance Requirements*. Provide the following per virtual machine average performance parameters that you want to be applied to your new VMs that will be deployed:
* *Average IOPS per VM*. 
Enter the number of IOPS required for your file systems. If you are unsure, you can use the default of 3 IOPS per GiB of SSD storage for Amazon FSx for ONTAP  file systems. For example, if you deploy 2,000 GiB of capacity, this will be translated to 6,000 IOPS. 
We recommend that you begin with a smaller IOPS setting. You can increase your provisioned SSD IOPS after the file system is created as workloads are migrated or deployed.
* *Average I/O block size*. 
The size of each block containing read or write operations. The default size is 4 KB.
A larger block size may be better for large sequential read and write workloads. A smaller block size may offer better performance for workloads that perform small random writes to sparse files or to large files.
* *Average write ratio*. 
The percentage of operations that are write operations for your workloads. The default ratio is 30% writes and 70% reads.
.. *Average data reduction ratio*. Choose from among the three common data reduction selection values. Select “1:1 - No reduction”, “1:1.25 - 20% reduction”, or “1:1.5 - 33% reduction”.
.. *Headroom percentage*. Enter the percentage of capacity growth that is added to the capacity for your FSx for ONTAP systems. 
+
Note that if you select an amount less than 20% that you won't be able to create volume snapshots for protection and long-term backups.
