After the new infrastructure is up and running, you can migrate data from your old systems to your new FSx for ONTAP file systems. 

Use a tool such as VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension (HCX) to move your data from your old virtual machine storage to the FSx for NetApp ONTAP volumes connected to your new virtual machines. VMware HCX core functionality enables you to migrate workloads from your on-premises data center to your SDDC transparently.
