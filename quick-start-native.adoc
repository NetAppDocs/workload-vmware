Get started with the VMware migration advisor to move your current infrastructure to Amazon EC2 using Amazon FSx for ONTAP as external NFS datastores.

Before you get started, you should have an understanding of https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/operational-modes.html[operational modes^].

You'll need to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[set up an account with workload factory^] and log in using one of the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Go to the https://console.workloads.netapp.com[workload factory console^] and sign up. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[Learn more about creating accounts].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can use workload factory in _Basic_ mode without adding credentials to access your AWS account. Adding AWS credentials to workload factory in either _Read_ or _Automate_ mode gives your workload factory account the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP file systems, and to deploy and manage workloads within Amazon EC2.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can use the Migration advisor VM collector script or RVTools to capture your current VM configurations in order to create a deployment plan. You can also import an existing deployment plan as a template and then modify any required attributes.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Launch the VMware migration advisor and select the VMs that you want to migrate to Amazon EC2 infrastructure using an Amazon FSx for ONTAP file system as external NFS datastores. You can make some modifications before you save the plan.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Your Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) offers network options for connecting to the FSx for ONTAP file system by using the VPC Peering capability to extend network connectivity to the external NFS storage volumes.
