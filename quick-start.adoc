Get started with the VMware Cloud on AWS onboarding advisor to move your current infrastructure to VMware Cloud on AWS using Amazon FSx for ONTAP as external NFS datastores.

Before you get started, you should have an understanding of https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/workload-factory-accounts.html[Workload Factory accounts] and https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/operational-modes.html[operational modes].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Go to the https://console.workloads.netapp.com[Workload Factory console^] and sign up. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/sign-up-saas.html[Learn more about creating accounts].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can use Workload Factory in _Basic_ mode without adding credentials to access your AWS account. However, adding AWS credentials to your account gives Workload Factory the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP file systems, and to manage your VMware workloads.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[See how to add credentials and permissions].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can use the Onboarding Advisor Data Collector script or RVTools to capture your current VM configurations in order to create a deployment plan. You can also import an existing deployment plan as a template and then modify any required attributes.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-4.png[Four] Create a deployment plan using the VMware Cloud on AWS onboarding advisor 

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Launch the VMware Cloud on AWS onboarding advisor and select the VMs that you want to migrate to the new VMware Cloud on AWS infrastructure using an Amazon FSx for ONTAP file system as external NFS datastores.

.image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/common/main/media/number-5.png[Five] Download the deployment plan

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Download the deployment plan so that you can deploy the new infrastructure. You can download a PDF version of the plan first so that it can be reviewed by other members of your organization.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Deploy the new infrastructure using a VMware tool or by using an external tool such as XYZ.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Use an external tool such as XYZ and 123 to move your data from your old virtual machine storage to the FSx for NetApp ONTAP volumes connected to your new virtual machines.
