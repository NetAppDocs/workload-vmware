Get started with the VMware migration advisor to move your current infrastructure to VMware Cloud on AWS using Amazon FSx for ONTAP as external NFS datastores.

Before you get started, you should have an understanding of https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/operational-modes.html[operational modes^].

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can use Workload Factory in _Basic_ mode without adding credentials to access your AWS account. Adding AWS credentials to Workload Factory in either _read-only_ or _read/write_ mode gives your Workload Factory account the permissions needed to create and manage FSx for ONTAP file systems, and to deploy and manage workloads within VMware Cloud.
