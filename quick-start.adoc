You don't need a Connector to get started with Workload Factory, but you can create a Connector to unlock all Workload Factory features and services. The Connector is NetApp software that enables Workload Factory to manage resources and processes within your hybrid cloud environment.

A Workload Factory Account Admin can create a Connector in your cloud or on-premises network.
